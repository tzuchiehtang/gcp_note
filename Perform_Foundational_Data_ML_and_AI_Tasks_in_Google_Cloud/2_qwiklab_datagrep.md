# Dataprep

## Overview
Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. Cloud Dataprep is serverless and works at any scale. There is no infrastructure to deploy or manage. Easy data preparation with clicks and no code!

In this lab you use Dataprep to manipulate a dataset. You import datasets, correct mismatched data, transform data, and join data. If this is new to you, you'll know what it all is by the end of this lab.
